## Motivation and Objectives
Every Christmas I always do Monopoly with family and friends. It always gets heated there and it gave me motivation to win. I wanted to analyse Monopoly in an absolute way, using various methods that I find useful.

Here are the missions/objectives that I find worth investigating for now. There are definetly some overlap between the objectives, however I have put them in so if you want to use this repo, you can find some use out of it too. :
#### Finding the most valuable property
Currently evaluating using Markov chains to find the probabilities of you landing in a certain board. Also took account of chance and community chest forcing you to go to a station etc.
#### Finding the most optimal strategy
TBD
#### Countering the most 'optimal' strategy
TBD
#### Finding a bulletproof method of no counter
TBD
## Finding the most valuable property
### Absolute Value Equation
There are various factors that a property* can have, such as the price per house, base property cost, full colour probability, specialist perks (utilities, station), CC(Community Chest), Chance events. Using every factor we have, can we find a list from most valuable and least valuable.

**in this document, unless specified, property includes not just properties, but utilities and stations too.*
#### But what does it mean to be 'Valuable'?
#### Limitations and Key Assumptions
##### When Player gets a Chance card or CC, the deck is reshuffled
